### **General info:**
This project is an implementation of a chess game using the programming language Java. For the implementation, “swing” library was used in order to visualize everything using the Graphical User Interface it provides. The implementation supports matches between two human players (the one with the white pieces adn the one with the black ones) and it does not support (for now) any "human vs computer" feature.
